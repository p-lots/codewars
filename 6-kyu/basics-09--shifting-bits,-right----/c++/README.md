Your task is to determine the <font size="+1">Next Lower Power of 2</font> to a given input number - or something like that...;-)<br><br>
Here it's easy, you don't have to check errors or incorrect input values, every thing is ok without bad tricks, only int numbers as input and output;-)...<br><br> 
And please consider: You have to <u>use bit shift operations</u> to solve this "problem", no multiplication, no Math.Pow() or **...<br><br>
Some easy examples:<br>
````
Input: 2     => Output: 1 
Input: 7     => Output: 4
Input: 0     => Output: ?
Input: -128  => Output: -256
````

There are some static tests at the beginning and many random tests if you submit your solution.<br>&nbsp;<br>
Perhaps you can look at <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/basics-10-shifting-bits-next-higher-power-of-2" target=_blank>Shifting Bits Next Higher Power</a> too;-)?
