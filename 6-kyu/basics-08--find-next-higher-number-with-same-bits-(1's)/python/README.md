Your task is to <font size="+1">Find the next higher number (int) with same '1'- Bits</font>.<br><br>
I.e. as much '1' bits as before and output next higher than input. Input is always an int >0 up to 1<<30. No bad cases or special tricks... 

<b>Some easy examples:</b><br>
```
Input: 129  => Output: 130 (10000001 => 10000010)
Input: 127 => Output: 191 (01111111 => 10111111)
Input: 1 => Output: 2 (01 => 10)
Input: 323423 => Output: 323439 (1001110111101011111 => 1001110111101101111)
```
First some static tests, later on many random tests too;-)!<br>
