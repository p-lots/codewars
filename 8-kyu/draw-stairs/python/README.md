given a number n, draw stairs with 'I' n tall and n wide, with the tallest in the top left. Example (with - to represent spaces; DO NOT USE THEM IN THE SOLUTIONS! USE SPACES IN SOLUTION! the "-"s are for clarity.):
```draw_stairs(3) == '''I\n_I\n__I'''```

For example, a 7-step stairs should be drawn like this:

```javascript
const sevenStepStairs = drawStairs(7);
```

```
