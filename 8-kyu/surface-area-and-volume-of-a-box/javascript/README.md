```if-not:sql
Write a function that returns the total surface area and volume of a box.
```
```if:sql
You are given a table `box` with the following columns: `width (int)`, `height (int)`, `depth (int)`. Those values will be greater than 0. 

Write an SQL query that returns these columns:  
- `width`  
- `height`  
- `depth`  
- `area (int)` - the total surface area of the box.
- `volume (int)` - the volume of the box.
Sort the results by `area` ascending, then by `volume` ascending, then by `width` ascending, and finally by `height` in ascending order.
```
```if-not:sql
The given input will be three positive non-zero integers: `width`, `height`, and `depth`.

The output will be language dependant, so please check sample tests for the corresponding data type, (`list`, `tuple`, `struct`, `query`, etcetera).
