Given a number `n`, return the number of positive odd numbers below `n`, EASY!

### Examples (Input -> Output)
```
7  -> 3 (because odd numbers below 7 are [1, 3, 5])
15 -> 7 (because odd numbers below 15 are [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13])
```

Expect large Inputs!

Use `numEncoding BinaryScott`

**Note for Brainfuck:**

Input 5 means the input will be a character with ASCII code 5, not the character '5'. Output similarly. The valid input range is 0 <= input <= 255. You will never have to read more than one byte.
