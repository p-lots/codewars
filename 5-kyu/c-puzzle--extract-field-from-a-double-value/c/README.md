# Task

A double precision floating-point type (`double`)
has the following format:

```
> Sign (1 bit)
| > Exponent (11 bits)
| |           > Mantissa (52 bits)
| |           |
s eeeeeeeeeee mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...mm
```

Given a `double` value, extract its `exponent` part and
return the value as an `int`.

# Restrictions

You can't use any of the characters `+-*/%&|^~<>#?` in your code, which means:

* You can't do any arithmetic/bitwise operations.
* You can't do any pointer/address operations.
* You can't include any extra files.
