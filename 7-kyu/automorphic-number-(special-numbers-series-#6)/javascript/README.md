A number is called **Automorphic number** if and only if its square ends in the same digits as the number itself. For example, `25` is an automorphic number because its square (`625`) ends with `25`.

### Task
Given a positive number, determine if it is Automorphic or not. If it is, return `"Automorphic"`, otherwise return `"Not!!"`

### Examples 

- `25` is an automorphic number, because `$ 25^2 = 625 $` ends with `25`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- `13` is not an automorphic number, because `$ 13^2 = 169 $` does not end with `13`, so return `"Not!!"`.
- `76` is an automorphic number, because `$ 76^2 = 5776 $` ends with `76`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- `225` is not an automorphic number, because `$ 225^2 = 50625 $` does not end with `225`, so return `"Not!!"`.
- `625` is an automorphic number, because `$ 625^2 = 390625 $` ends with `625`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- `1` is an automorphic number, because `$ 1^2 = 1 $` ends with `1`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
- `6` is an automorphic number, because `$ 6^2 = 36 $` ends with `6`, so return `"Automorphic"`.
