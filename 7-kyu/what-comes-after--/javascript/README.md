You will be given two inputs: a string of words and a letter. For each string, return the alphabetic character after every instance of letter(case insensitive). 

If there is a number, punctuation or underscore following the letter, it should not be returned. 

```
If letter = 'r':
"are you really learning Ruby?" # => "eenu"
"Katy Perry is on the radio!"   # => "rya"
"Pirates say arrrrrrrrr."       # => "arrrrrrrr"
"r8 your friend"                # => "i"
```

Return an empty string if there are no instances of `letter` in the given string.
