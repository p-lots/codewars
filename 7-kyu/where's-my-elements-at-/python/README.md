An array is a data structure in which a collection of different data stored continuously in memory. This collection is usually accessed by a numerical index and allows near instant access to all of the data held by the array as opposed to other structures such as binary search trees or linked lists, where the computer has to traverse these structures to find the item being accessed.

To demonstrate, we'll calculate the position of an array element using some simple arithmetic.

# Task Overview
Given:
* `begin`, a number which represents the location of the beginning of the array in memory,
* `end`, a number which represents the location of the end of the array in memory,
* `index`, a zero-based numerical key for the element being accessed,
* `size`, a number representing the size in bytes of each item of the array, 


Return the memory address of the element being accessed.

```if:c
In C, `begin` and `end` will be pointers, and you must return a pointer to `array[index].`
```

If the index is negative or the address of the memory being accessed is at or greater than the end of the array, throw an `Error` (JS) / `IndexError` (Python). In C return `NULL` instead.

Otherwise, who knows *what* data we could be accessing!

# Usage Example
```javascript
elementLocation(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x3, 0x8) => 0x1018
elementLocation(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x8, 0x8) // throws Error
elementLocation(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x3, 0x4) => 0x200C
elementLocation(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x0, 0x4) => 0x2000
```

```python
element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x3, 0x8) => 0x1018
element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x8, 0x8) # throws IndexError
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x3, 0x4) => 0x200C
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x0, 0x4) => 0x2000
```

```c
element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x3, 0x8) => 0x1018
element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x8, 0x8) => NULL
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x3, 0x4) => 0x200C
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x0, 0x4) => 0x2000
```
