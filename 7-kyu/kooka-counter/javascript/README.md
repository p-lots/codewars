A family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laughing_kookaburra">kookaburras</a> are in my backyard.

I can't see them all, but I can hear them!

# How many kookaburras are there?

## Hint 

The trick to counting kookaburras is to listen carefully

* The males sound like ```HaHaHa```...

* The females sound like ```hahaha```...

* And they always alternate male/female

## Examples

* `ha` = female => 1
* `Ha` = male => 1
* `Haha` = male + female => 2
* `haHa` = female + male => 2
* `hahahahaha` = female => 1
* `hahahahahaHaHaHa` = female + male => 2
* `HaHaHahahaHaHa` = male + female + male => 3
