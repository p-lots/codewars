Ever the learned traveller, Alan Partridge has pretty strong views on London:

```
"Go to London. I guarantee you'll either be mugged or not appreciated.
Catch the train to London, stopping at Rejection, Disappointment, Backstabbing Central and Shattered Dreams Parkway."
```
Your job is to check that the provided list of stations contains all of the stops Alan mentions. There will be other stations in the array.  Example:

```
['Rejection', 'Disappointment', 'Backstabbing Central', 'Shattered Dreams Parkway']
```

If the stations all appear, return 'Smell my cheese you mother!', if not,  return 'No, seriously, run. You will miss it. '.
