# Task

Write a function `f` (in C# `F`) that returns `Hello, world!` string. 
But there is one thing, you cannot use `helowrd` letters.

The `C#` test cases ignore checking for banned letters in words `class`, `string` and `public`.  
The `C++` test cases ignore checking for banned letters in words `string`, `std` and `return`.  

Have fun!
