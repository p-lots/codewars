Yup, fill the provided set with the keywords of your language.

~~~if:bf
Write a program that will output all 8 instuctions.

The test provides the number of needed keywords, and the error messages contain hints if you need help. 
<!--Translators: Add 3 keywords, one of which should be difficult/obscure.-->
## Details:
~~~if-not:bf
- Keywords are the words put aside as instructions for the compiler. For example (use these to get started):
```python
if True nonlocal
```
```rust
if true extern
```
```csharp
if true stackalloc
```
- If your language has contextual or "soft" keywords, you won't find them here.
  Only keywords that are always recognized are included.
- The example test case will only check your list length.
- The keywords should be strings.

Good luck, and bonus points for not searching anything up. ;)
