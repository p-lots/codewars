You are given 2 two-digit numbers. You should check if they are similar by comparing their numbers, and return the result in %.

Example:
  1) compare(13,14)=50%;
  2) compare(23,22)=50%;
  3) compare(15,51)=100%;
  4) compare(12,34)=0%.
  
~~~if:c
In C language you should return P_100, P_50 and P_0 instead of strings "100%", "50%", "0%"
