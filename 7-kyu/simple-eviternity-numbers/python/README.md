An eviternity number is a number which:
* contains only digits 8, 5 and 3, and 
* the count of the digit `8` >= count of digit `5` >= count of digit `3`. 

The first few eviternity numbers are as follows. 
```Haskell
[8, 58, 85, 88, 358, 385, 538, 583, 588, 835, 853, 858, 885, 888]
```
You will be given two integers, `a` and `b`, and your task is to return the number of eviternity numbers in the range `>= a and < b`.
```
For example:
a=0, b=1000 => 14, because they are [8, 58, 85, 88, 358, 385, 538, 583, 588, 835, 853, 858, 885, 888]
```

The upper bound will not exceed `500,000`.

More examples in test cases. Good luck!
