It's Friday the 13th, and Jason is ready for his first killing spree!

Create a function, killcount, that accepts two arguments: an array of array pairs (the conselor's name and intelligence - ["Chad", 2]) and an integer representing Jason's intellegence. 

Ruby, Python, Crystal:
```ruby
counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]]
jason = 7
```
```python
counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]]
jason = 7
```
```crystal
counselors = [{"Chad", 2}, {"Tommy", 9}]
jason = 7
```
JavaScript:
```javascript
var counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]];
var jason = 7;
```
PHP:
```php
$counselors = [["Chad", 2], ["Tommy", 9]];
$jason = 7;
```

Your function must return an array of the names of all the counselors who can be outsmarted and killed by Jason.
