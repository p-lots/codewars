Calculations with time units can be confusing, because we are used to calculating in the decimal system in every day use. An hour, however, consists of sixty minutes, which in turn consist of sixty seconds each.

When dealing with multiple entries of measured time - for example, in a working time recording - it can get hard to correctly sum up the total. A seemingly natural algorithm is to add up hours and minutes separately, then divmod the minutes with 60 to get additional complete hours and remaining minutes.

In Germany, some companies use decimal time (in German: "Industriezeit" or "Industriestunden") to keep track of working hours, which makes it a lot easier to calculate multiple entries.</details>
