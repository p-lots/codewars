Write a function that takes a positive integer n, sums all the cubed values from 1 to n, and returns that sum.

Assume that the input n will always be a positive integer.

Examples:

```javascript
sumCubes(2) // 9
// sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8
```
```python
sum_cubes(2)
> 9 
# sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8
```
```cpp
sum_cubes(3) should return 36 
# sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27
```

```haskell
sumCubes 2 = 9
-- sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8

sumCubes 3 = 36
-- sum of the cubes of 1, 2, and 3 is 1 + 8 + 27
```
```go
SumCubes(2) == 9
// sum of the cubes of 1 and 2 is 1 + 8
```
