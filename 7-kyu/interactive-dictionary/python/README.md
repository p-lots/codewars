In this kata, your job is to create a class Dictionary which you can add words to and their entries. Example:
```python
>>> d = Dictionary()

>>> d.newentry('Apple', 'A fruit that grows on trees')

>>> print(d.look('Apple'))
A fruit that grows on trees

>>> print(d.look('Banana'))
Can't find entry for Banana
```
```java
>>> Dictionary d = new Dictionary();

>>> d.newEntry("Apple", "A fruit that grows on trees");

>>> System.out.println(d.look("Apple"));
A fruit that grows on trees

>>> System.out.println(d.look("Banana"));
Cant find entry for Banana
```
```javascript
>>> let d = new Dictionary();

>>> d.newEntry("Apple", "A fruit that grows on trees");

>>> console.log(d.look("Apple"));
A fruit that grows on trees

>>> console.log(d.look("Banana"));
Can't find entry for Banana
```

Good luck and happy coding!
