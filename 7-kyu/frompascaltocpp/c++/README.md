One day when I was little, I had to write a cycle, but I did not know how to do it, and I did not have internet. So I tried to find a solution in the book. I only had a ```Delphi``` book (```Pascal```). And I found the piece of code that suits me:

```  
begin
	repeat
		Sum := Sum + start;
	    start := start + 1;
	until(start>=finish);
end;
```

And put it in the code. But it does not work. I found out that instead of ```:=``` on ```C++``` you need to put ```=```. And I replaced it, but it still did not work. Could you help me to adapt the code to ```C++```. But I have one condition: You can not change the code that is written in ```Pascal```.
In the test, the code should also work.
