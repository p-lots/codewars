You are given a class **Person** with a single field named *age* (>=0).
We would like to be able to compare different persons according to their age.

Your task is to implement the following comparison operators:

* '=='
* '!='
* '<='
* '>='
* '<'
* '>'

Try to re-use implementaion as much as possible, for example: '<' operator can be implemented using '<=' and '!='.

Good luck!
