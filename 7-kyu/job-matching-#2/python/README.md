Consider a matchmaking system that is designed to deliver jobs to software developers on a continual basis. As more quality jobs are handpicked into the system, they will be matched to all the enrolled developers; affording them better opportunities daily. 

This means that somewhere in the system there exists functionality to take a job and match it against enrolled candidates. There are several factors that go into this matching, but we'll focus on two for the purposes of this Kata.

Create a function `match` which takes a `job`, and filters a list of `candidates` to the ones that match the job. We'll focus on two matching properties for this Kata: equity and location.

### Equity
The candidate has an equity property (boolean) indicating if they desire equity, while the job will have a maximum equity property (float) representing the max amount of equity offered. If the maximum equity is zero, we can infer there is no equity offered. A job will match unless the candidate desires equity, but the job does not offer any.

### Location
The candidate will have two location properties: current location and desired locations. A job can be located in multiple places as well which will be represented by its locations property. A match is when a job location is either in the candidate's current location or any of the candidate's desired locations. 

So the candidate list might look like this: 

```javascript
let candidates = [{
  desiresEquity: true, 
  currentLocation: 'New York',
  desiredLocations: ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles', 'Colorado']
}, ...];
```
```ruby
candidates = [{ 
  'desires_equity' => true,
  'current_location' => 'New York',
  'desired_locations' => ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
}, ...]
```
```python
candidates = [{
  'desires_equity': True,
  'current_location': 'New York',
  'desired_locations': ['San Francisco', 'Los Angeles']
}, ...]
```

And a job might look like this: 

```javascript
let job = { 
  equityMax: 1.2, 
  locations: ['New York', 'Kentucky'] 
}
```
```ruby
job = {
  'equity_max' => 1.2,
  'locations' => ['New York', 'Kentucky']
}
```
```python
job = {
  'equity_max': 1.2,
  'locations': ['New York', 'Kentucky']
}
```
