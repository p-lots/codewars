Given an array of integers.

Return a number that is the sum of

1. The product of all the non-negative numbers
2. The sum of all the negative numbers

# Edge cases
- If there are no non-negative numbers, assume the product of them to be 1.
- Similarly, if there are no negative numbers, assume the sum of them to be 0.
- If the array is null, result should be 0.

# For example:
```javascript
mathEngine([1, 2, 3, -4, -5]) // should return -3
```

```ruby
math_engine([1, 2, 3, -4, -5]) # should return -3
```

```python
math_engine([1, 2, 3, -4, -5]) # should return -3
```
