Remember the spongebob meme that is meant to make fun of people by repeating what they say in a mocking way?

You need to create a function that converts the input into this format, with the output being the same string expect there is a pattern of uppercase and lowercase letters.

Examples:
```javascript
spongeMeme("stop Making spongebob Memes!") // => 'StOp mAkInG SpOnGeBoB MeMeS!'
spongeMeme("colored teens cant Be successful in tech") // =>'CoLoReD TeEnS CaNt bE SuCcEsSfUl iN TeCh'
```

```ruby
sponge_meme("stop Making spongebob Memes!") # => 'StOp mAkInG SpOnGeBoB MeMeS!'
```
