# Task

You have set an alarm for some of the weekdays.

Days of the week are encoded in binary representation like this:

```
0000001 - Sunday
0000010 - Monday
0000100 - Tuesday
0001000 - Wednesday
0010000 - Thursday
0100000 - Friday 
1000000 - Saturday
```

For example, if your alarm is set only for Sunday and Friday, the representation will be `0100001`. 

Given the current day of the week, your task is to find the day of the week when the alarm will ring next time.

# Input/Output

- `[input]` integer `Current Day`

The weekdays range from 1 to 7, 1 is Sunday and 7 is Saturday.


- `[input]` integer `Available Weekdays`

An integer between 1 and 127, inclusive (which means the alarm will ring at least once per week). Days of the week are encoded in its binary representation.


- `[output]` an integer

The next day available. The weekday format is same as `Current Day`.

# Example

For `Current Day = 4, Available Weekdays = 42`, the result should be `6`.
 
```
Current Day = 4 means current day is Wednesday
Available Weekdays = 42, convert to binary is "0101010"
So the next day the alarm will ring is Friday (6)
```
