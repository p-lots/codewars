~~~if:javascript
Given an 2D array of size ```m * n```. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.
~~~
~~~if:cpp
Given an 2D vector of size ```m * n```. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.
~~~
~~~if:python
Given an 2D list of size ```m * n```. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.

~~~if:cfml
Given an 2D array of size ```m * n```. Your task is to find the sum of minimum value in each row.
~~~

For Example:
```cpp
{
  {1,2,3,4,5}, //minimum value of row is 1
  {5,6,7,8,9}, //minimum value of row is 5
  {20,21,34,56,100} //minimum value of row is 20
}
```
```python
[
  [1,2,3,4,5], # minimum value of row is 1
  [5,6,7,8,9], # minimum value of row is 5
  [20,21,34,56,100] # minimum value of row is 20
]
```
```javascript
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], // minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100] // minimum value of row is 20
]
```
```cfml
[
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], // minimum value of row is 1
  [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], // minimum value of row is 5
  [20, 21, 34, 56, 100] // minimum value of row is 20
]
```
So, the function should return ```26``` because sum of minimums is as ```1 + 5 + 20 = 26```
