In this kata, you will write an arithmetic list which is basically a list that contains consecutive terms in the sequence.
<br />
You will be given three parameters :

+ `first` the first term in the sequence
+ `c` the constant that you are going to <strong>ADD</strong> ( since it is an arithmetic sequence...)
+ `l` the number of terms that should be `return`ed
