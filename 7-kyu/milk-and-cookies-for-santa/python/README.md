### Happy Holidays fellow Code Warriors!
It's almost Christmas Eve, so we need to prepare some milk and cookies for Santa! Wait... when exactly do we need to do that?

### Time for Milk and Cookies
Complete the function function that accepts a `Date` object, and returns `true` if it's Christmas Eve (December 24th), `false` otherwise.
~~~if:js
Keep in mind Javascript's Date month is 0 based!

### Examples

```js
timeForMilkAndCookies(new Date(2013, 11, 24))  // true
timeForMilkAndCookies(new Date(2013, 0, 23))   // false
timeForMilkAndCookies(new Date(3000, 11, 24))  // true
