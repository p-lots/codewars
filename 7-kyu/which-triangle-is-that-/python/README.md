Build a function that will take the length of each side of a triangle and return if it's either an Equilateral, an Isosceles, a Scalene or an invalid triangle.

It has to return a string with the type of triangle.       
For example: 
```javascript
typeOfTriangle(2,2,1) --> "Isosceles"
```
```coffeescript
typeOfTriangle(2,2,1) --> "Isosceles"
```
```ruby
type_of_triangle(2, 2, 1) --> "Isosceles"
```
```python
type_of_triangle(2, 2, 1) --> "Isosceles"
```
