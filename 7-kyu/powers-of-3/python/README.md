Given a positive integer N, return the largest integer k such that 3^k < N.

For example,

```python
largestPower(3) = 0
largestPower(4) = 1
```
```csharp
Kata.LargestPower(3) => 0
Kata.LargestPower(4) => 1
```

You may assume that the input to your function is always a positive integer.
