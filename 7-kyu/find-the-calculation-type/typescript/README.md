You have to create a function which receives 3 number arguments: 2 operands `a` and `b`, and the result of an unknown operation performed on them.

Based on those 3 values you have to return a string, that describes which operation was used to get the given result.

The possible return strings are:
  `"addition"`,
  `"subtraction"`,
  `"multiplication"`,
  `"division"`.

## Examples:
```javascript
(a = 1, b = 2, result = 3)   --> 1 ? 2 = 3   --> "addition"
(a = 5, b = 2, result = 2.5) --> 5 ? 2 = 2.5 --> "division"
```

## Notes
* The `/` operator performs a plain division without rounding.
* You can assume that there will always be a unique valid answer (no ambiguous cases like e.g. `1 ? 0 = 0` which could be either `-` or `+`, or `3 ? 1 = 3` which could be either `*` or `/`).
* You can assume that there will be no division by `0`
