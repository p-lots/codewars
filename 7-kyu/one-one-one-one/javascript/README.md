Write
```javascript
function consecutiveOnes(nums) {}
```
```cobol
        ConsecutiveOnes(nums)
```
that takes in array ```nums``` and returns the maximum consecutive ```1's```

For example
```javascript

consecutiveOnes([1, 1, 0, 0, 1]) === 2
consecutiveOnes([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) === 0
```
```cobol
      ConsecutiveOnes([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0]) => 3
      ConsecutiveOnes([1, 1, 0, 0, 1]) => 2
      ConsecutiveOnes([0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) => 0
```
