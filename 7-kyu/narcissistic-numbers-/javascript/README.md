A Narcissistic Number is a number of length n in which the sum of its digits to the power of n is equal to the original number. If this seems confusing, refer to the example below.

Ex: 153, where n = 3 (number of digits in 153)<br/>
1<sup>3</sup> + 5<sup>3</sup> + 3<sup>3</sup> = 153

Write a method <code>is_narcissistic(i)</code> (in Haskell: <code>isNarcissistic :: Integer -> Bool</code>) which returns whether or not i is a Narcissistic Number.
