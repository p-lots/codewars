Example: the number 6 is a triangular number because all sides of a triangle has the same amount of points.

```
Hint!
T(n) = n * (n + 1) / 2,
n - is the size of one side.
T(n) - is the triangular number.
```

Given a number 'T' from interval <u>[1; 2147483646]</u>, find if it is triangular number or not.
