[Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-set-objects.)

A **Set** lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like `.add`, `.clear`, `.has` . . . **BUT** some "Set operations" are missing, like . . . 

# Complement

Two sets can be "subtracted". The **relative complement** of B in A, denoted by `A \ B` (or `A − B`), is the set of all elements that are members of A but not members of B. Note that it is valid to "subtract" members of a set that are not in the set, such as removing the element green from the set {1, 2, 3}; doing so has no effect.

### Examples:
```
  {1, 2} \ {1, 2} = ∅.
  {1, 2, 3, 4} \ {1, 3} = {2, 4}.
```

# Task

Create function `diff` getting 2 sets as arguments and returning a **new Set** as result of relative complement of second set in first.

### Examples:
```javascript
A = new Set([1,2]);
B = new Set([2,3]);

diff(A,B) // -> {1}
diff(B,A) // -> {3}
```
