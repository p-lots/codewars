position  -> (string)
age       -> (int)
dribbling -> (int)
pass      -> (int)
shoot     -> (int)
```
```coffeescript
name      -> (string)
position  -> (string)
age       -> (int)
dribbling -> (int)
pass      -> (int)
shoot     -> (int)
```
```csharp
Name      => (string)
Position  => (string)
Age       => (int)
Dribbling => (int)
Pass      => (int)
Shoot     => (int)
```

```if:csharp
Note: If applicable, these properties need to be public.
```

### Example
```javascript
myPlayer = new Player("Dumbo", "Kata Coder", 1,2,3,4);

myPlayer.name => "Dumbo"
myPlayer.position => "Kata Coder"
myPlayer.age => 1
myPlayer.dribbling => 2
myPlayer.pass => 3
myPlayer.shoot => 4
```
```coffeescript
myPlayer = new Player("Dumbo", "Kata Coder", 1,2,3,4);

myPlayer.name => "Dumbo"
myPlayer.position => "Kata Coder"
myPlayer.age => 1
myPlayer.dribbling => 2
myPlayer.pass => 3
myPlayer.shoot => 4
```
```csharp
Player player = new Player("Player", "Right Winger", 25, 75, 90, 65);
player.Name => "Player"
player.Position => "Right Winger"
player.Age => 25
