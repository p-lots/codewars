Write a function called  that takes 3 values. The first and third values are numbers. The second value is a character.

* If the character is `"+"` , `"-"`, `"*"`, or `"/"`, the function will return the result of the corresponding mathematical function on the two numbers.
* If the string is not one of the specified characters, the function should return null (throw an `ArgumentException` in C#).
* Keep in mind, you cannot divide by zero. If an attempt to divide by zero is made, return `null` / `None` (Python) / throw an `ArgumentException` (C#).
