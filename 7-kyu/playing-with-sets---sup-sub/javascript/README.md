[Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-set-objects.)

A **Set** lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like `.add`, `.clear`, `.has` . . . **BUT** some "Set operations" are missing, like . . . 

# Subset and Superset

If every member of set `A` is also a member of set `B`, then A is said to be a subset of B, written A ⊆ B (also pronounced "A *is contained in* B"). Equivalently, we can write B ⊇ A, read as "B *is a superset of* A", "B *includes* A", or "B *contains* A".

### Example:
```
  {1, 3} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4}.
  {1, 2, 3, 4} ⊆ {1, 2, 3, 4}.
  
  {1, 2, 3, 4} ⊇ {1, 3}.
  {1, 2, 3, 4} ⊇ {1, 2, 3, 4}.
```

# Task

Create 2 functions:

* `isSubsetOf` getting 2 sets as arguments and returning `true` if 2d set contains **all elements** of 1st one.

* `isSupersetOf` getting 2 sets as arguments and returning `true` if 1st set contains **all elements** of 2d one.

### Examples:
```javascript
A = new Set([1,2]);
B = new Set([1,2,3]);

isSubsetOf(A,B) // -> true
isSubsetOf(B,A) // -> false

isSupersetOf(A,B) // -> false
isSupersetOf(B,A) // -> true
```
