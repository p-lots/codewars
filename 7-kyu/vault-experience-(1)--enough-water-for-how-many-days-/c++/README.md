<b>Hello dweller,</b><br>
<br>
I'm the overseer of our vault, in which we all live.<br>
<br>
I make it short: We are out of water. The only question is when!<br>
Here is a list of all dwellers with their respective age <code>int[] ageOfDweller</code>.<br>
In our tank currently are <code>int water</code> liters of water.<br>
I want to know from you: How long will rich our supplies.<br>
<br>
<i>Remember!</i><br>
Each dweller has a different water consumption.<br>
A dweller under 18 consumes 1 liter per day, everyone older than 50 needs 1.5 liters and the rest needs 2 liters per day.<br>
Each dweller must get its prescribed ration of water, every day!<br>
If not satisfied all dweller, then our days are numbered.<br>
<br>
<b>Good luck! I'll bet on you!</b><br>
<br>
<br><i>Note from Vault Technicians:</i>
<br>
Your program returns a positive integer. The residual water is not calculated.<br>
<code>return -1;</code> - If no dweller living inside of the Vault.<br>
<br>
<br>
- - -<br>
<i>Imagine further "Vault experience":</i><br>
