For this kata you will have to forget how to add two numbers.

It can be best explained using the following meme:

In simple terms, our method does not like the principle of carrying over numbers and just writes down every number it calculates :-)

You may assume both integers are positive integers.

## Examples 

```math
\large
\begin{array}{lll}
    & 1 & 6 \\
  + & 1 & 8 \\ \hline
  & 2 & 1 4 \\
\end{array}
\qquad
\large
\begin{array}{lll}
    & 2 & 6  \\
  + & 3 & 9  \\ \hline
    & 5 & 15 \\
\end{array}
\qquad
```
&nbsp; 
```math
\large
\begin{array}{lll}
    & 1 & 2  & 2 \\
  + &   & 8  & 1 \\ \hline
    & 1 & 10 & 3 \\
\end{array}
\qquad
\large
\begin{array}{lll}
    & 7  & 2 \\
  + &    & 9 \\ \hline
    & 7 & 11 \\
\end{array}

```

You may assume both integers are positive integers and the result will not be bigger than `Integer.MAX_VALUE`
